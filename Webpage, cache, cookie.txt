How a WebPage loads, CACHE, COOKIES, REDIRECTION
First the browser checks for the cached version(Stored in browser memory)
If not, it initiates a DNS lookup to find IP address associated with the domain.
Once an IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a transmission control protocol(TCP) connection with the server hosting the website.
If the website uses HTTPs, a TLS/SSL handshake is performed to establish a secure connection.
The browser sends an HTTP request, the server sends back HTTP response along with HTML, CSS, JS, images etc.
The browser parses HTML, create DOM, CSS, JS create CSSOM and execute JS code.
Resources are loaded and rendered

CACHE
