API 
MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE : sw development approach where entire app is build as a single, self-contained unit with a unified codebase. 
  - single codebase
  - tightly coupled components 
  - single deployment unit
  - single database, usually.
Advantages : 
  - Simpler initial development, ease of deployment, easy bug fix, efficient communication
Disadvantages :
  - Scalability, reliability, higher maintenance cost 
MICROSERVICES : all the services are divided into smaller services which interact with each other using APIs
API : Application programming interface - collection of functions and procedures which allow us to communicate two applications or libraries, connect frontend to backend.
Authentication : Validating a user/ Identification (Password, Token, Biometric)
Authorization : Allowing certain actions. 
Need for Authorization : 
- Track who is making requests
- Track usage of API
- Apply different permission level to different user.
Types of Authorization :
API Key : Long string used, usually included either in request URL or request header.
- Identifies the person making API calls
- PUBLIC KEY : usually include in request
- PRIVATE KEY : Used only in server to server communication.
Basic Auth : Places username, password in the request header.
- Encoded un and pw using base64
- Uses HTTPs
- When server receives the request, decrypts the message and examine the header
HMAC : Hash based message authorization code
- Sender and receiver knows a secret key
- Msg is encoded using secret key and passed through SHA(Secure Hashing Algorithm)
- The result value, as a signature is placed in request header
- The receiver uses the same system property and SHA to generate same string.

Components of API :  Endpoints, Methods, Header, parameter, Response code.
Token : String of codes containing data that verifies a specific user.

REST : representational state transfer : architectural style, any API that follows six constraints (rules)
1. Uniform Interface 
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Client-Server 
5. Layered System
6. Code on Demand

SOAP : Protocol, transfer information, uses XML, WS security and SSL, requires more resources and bandwidth, cannot be cached
REST : Architectural style, access a resource for data, plain text, HTML, XML, JSON, supports SSL and HTTPS, fewer resources and is lightweight, can be cached.

HTTP codes.

PUT : Update (whole info)
PATCH : Partial update
DELETE : Delete
POSTMAN : 
/collections/all : path parameter

Import : chrome-> Dev tools-> copy as cRUD-> import in postman


SCRIBBLE
get 200: url dala, hit 
reesponse body : 
to check : status code,  time taken,
validate some field like title, name etc
Post 201 : URL, inside body, raw , json add data () data to be sent , hit enter, check the sent details in response, code, time, functionality (Like an id is created)
put 200 : same as post, update entry
delete, response code can be 200 as well as 204
Invalid : 
404 not found, json body can be {} : empty json object as resource doesn't exist
